# Organic Shop

**A Microservices-based E-commerce Platform built with .NET 8**

This repository showcases the implementation of a modern e-commerce solution, "Organic Shop," designed using a microservices architecture and leveraging the power of .NET 8. The project emphasizes best practices in software architecture, including Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

## Key Features

* **.NET 8 and C# 12:** Utilizes the latest features and performance enhancements.
* **Microservices Architecture:** Decouples functionalities into independent services for scalability and maintainability.
* **Clean Architecture & DDD:** Promotes a well-structured, testable, and adaptable codebase.
* **Dockerized Deployment:** Simplifies deployment and management with containerization.
* **RabbitMQ & MassTransit:** Enables asynchronous communication between services.
* **gRPC:** Facilitates high-performance synchronous communication.
* **Yarp API Gateway:** Centralizes routing, security, and other cross-cutting concerns.
